# Introduction
This document provides the steb-by-step instructions to configure your computer to use the binary distribution of the [LSST](http://www.lsst.org) software stack using [CernVM FS](http://cernvm.cern.ch/portal/filesystem).

CERN's CernVM FS is a software component which allow you to mount, in **read-only mode** a remote software repository, which will appear to your computer as if the software was locally installed. At [CC-IN2P3](http://cc.in2p3.fr) we prepared a binary distribution of LSST stack to be used through CernVM FS. You will find below the procedure for installing CernVM FS and configuring it to use the binary LSST software repository.

Context and perspectives about this work can be found in [this presentation](https://speakerdeck.com/airnandez/experimenting-with-cernvm-fs-for-distributing-lsst-software).

**WARNING** : *please bear in mind that this work is experimental. Your feedback on how to improve it is very welcome. Scroll to the end of this document to know how you can provide feedback.*

# Expected Benefits
With this method, you need to install and configure CernVM FS only once. Once this is done, when your computer is connected to the network, you will find the available versions of the LSST software stack under the local directory:

	/cvmfs/lsst.in2p3.fr
	
This method of distributing the software is particularly useful for individuals: you don't need to install each official LSST software release by hand on your personal computer, but rather to automatically mount and use the binary distributions prepared for your convenience.

Please note that you don't need special privileges to use the LSST software stack distributed in this way: any user on a pre-configured computer can use the software. However, in order to install and configure CernVM FS, a one-time process, you need super-user privileges on the target machine.
	
# Installation
So far we have tested this installation on Scientific Linux 6, Scientific Linux 7 and Ubuntu 14.04. It may work on other platforms but we haven't verified that.

### Installing on Scientific Linux 6 and 7 (64 bits)
To download the software from CERN's repository and install it, as `root` do:

   	# cd /tmp
	# curl -O https://ecsft.cern.ch/dist/cvmfs/cvmfs-2.1.19/cvmfs-2.1.19-1.el6.x86_64.rpm
	# curl -O https://cvmrepo.web.cern.ch/cvmrepo/yum/cvmfs/EL/5/x86_64/cvmfs-keys-1.5-1.noarch.rpm
	# yum install --assumeyes ./cvmfs-*.rpm

### Installing on Ubuntu 14.04 (64 bits)
Some packages are either necessary or recommended on Ubuntu. To install them do (as `root`):

    # apt-get install autofs attr gdb git sysv-rc-conf
    
Download and install CernVM FS (as `root`):
    
    # cd /tmp
    # curl -O https://ecsft.cern.ch/dist/cvmfs/cvmfs-2.1.19/cvmfs_2.1.19_amd64.deb
    # curl -O https://ecsft.cern.ch/dist/cvmfs/cvmfs-keys/cvmfs-keys_1.5-1_all.deb
    # dpkg -i ./cvmfs-keys_1.5-1_all.deb  ./cvmfs_2.1.19_amd64.deb
    

# Configuration
The configuration of CernVM FS client to use the binary distribution of LSST software served by CC-IN2P3 is a *one-time operation*. It needs to be performed by user `root`.

* Run the utility:

		# cvmfs_config setup

	After this step, among other things, an unprivileged user `cvmfs` is created in your computer and several configuration files with sensible default values are located under `/etc/cvmfs`.
	
	The next steps modify the default configuration to the specifics of LSST repository hosted by CC-IN2P3.

* Create file `/etc/cvmfs/keys/lsst.in2p3.fr.pub`:
  
  		# cat > /etc/cvmfs/keys/lsst.in2p3.fr.pub <<-EOF
  		-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
		MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEAxpOBi4YSHya9NLFyjwko
		1QGO0cEbcN6JKMht8bfqUOsH/gdov8sUIlZ3XOzAqwHmb/F76QbtaftDXrJqwCXF

		kPIRNLPW8ZkMHFct8IvUUPNFgcEYflqBtB6HmWJcVVZDTE600pgdir+Pdlqd17XF
		AwIDAQAB
		-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
		EOF
		
	This text file contains the public key of CC-IN2P3's software repository for LSST. The CernVM FS client running on your machine needs this key to verify that it is talking to the expected server.
			
* Create the file `/etc/cvmfs/default.local`:
  		
  		# cat > /etc/cvmfs/default.local <<-EOF
  		CVMFS_REPOSITORIES=lsst.in2p3.fr
  		CVMFS_QUOTA_LIMIT=20000
  		# Default cache directory is '/var/lib/cvmfs' but you can change it by uncommenting
  		# and customizing the line below
  		# CVMFS_CACHE_BASE=/cvmfscache
  		EOF
  	
  	This file tells the CernVM FS client to mount the repository named `lsst.in2p3.fr` and to use a local disk cache of up to 20.000 MB. By default, the local cache is located at `/var/lib/cvmfs` but you can use another directory on your local disk. For instance, if you wish CernVM FS cache to be located under `/cvmfscache` uncomment the line below:
  	
  	 	CVMFS_CACHE_BASE=/cvmfscache
  	 	
  	You can also modify the size of the disk cache CernVM FS should use. Please bear in mind that the current LSST stack (v9.2) requires about 7GB of disk space. As you may want to use a few releases simultaneously we think 20.000MB is a reasonable starting point but feel free to adapt it as you consider suitable for your particular needs.
  		
* Create file `/etc/cvmfs/config.d/lsst.in2p3.fr.conf`:

   		# cat > /etc/cvmfs/config.d/lsst.in2p3.fr.conf <<-EOF
   		CVMFS_SERVER_URL="http://cccrnvmfs01.in2p3.fr/cvmfs/lsst.in2p3.fr"
   		CVMFS_HTTP_PROXY="http://cctbcrnvmfsli01.in2p3.fr:3128"
   		CVMFS_PUBLIC_KEY="/etc/cvmfs/keys/lsst.in2p3.fr.pub"
   		EOF
   		
* Set the permissions of the files created in the previous steps:

   		# chmod 0444 /etc/cvmfs/keys/lsst.in2p3.fr.pub
   		# chmod 0644 /etc/cvmfs/default.local /etc/cvmfs/config.d/lsst.in2p3.fr.conf
   		
* Check your configuration by running

   		# cvmfs_config chksetup
   	
  If everything is correct, this utility will print an explicit `OK` in which case you are ready to use LSST software stack. Otherwise, you will be presented with the relevant error message which will hopefully help you finding what's is wrong with your configuration.
  
* Restart `autofs` service so that it takes into account the modified configuration:

		# service autofs restart
		
* Configure `autofs` to start at boot time. On Scientific Linux do (as `root`):
	
		# chkconfig autofs on
		
	and on Ubuntu, do (as `root`):
	
		# sysv-rc-conf autofs on
		
	This is necessary to automatically mount the remote repository under `/cvmfs/lsst.in2p3.fr` any time you access a file or directory under that namespace.
		
Now you are ready to use the stack.
   		
# Usage
In order to use the LSST software stack, you need to setup your environment for a specific version for which there is a binary distribution available. For instance, to use LSST v9.2 do:

		$ cd /cvmfs/lsst.in2p3.fr/software/x86_64-slc6/lsst-v9.2
		$ source loadLSST.sh
		
Note that you don't need super-user privileges to use this distribution of the LSST software. For testing your installation you can run the LSST demo, as documented [here](https://confluence.lsstcorp.org/display/LSWUG/Testing+the+Installation).

# Advanced usage
Details on how to use this distribution mechanism for more advanced use cases are provided in the [Advanced Usage](AdvancedUsage.md) document. There you will find details on how you can develop your own software package which depends on other packages already present in the binary distribution.


# Troubleshooting
Please note that in order for this distribution mechanism to work for you, you need your machine to be connected to the network and able to contact CC-IN2P3 server. To check this is the case please do:

	$ curl --proxy http://cctbcrnvmfsli01.in2p3.fr:3128 --head http://cccrnvmfs01.in2p3.fr/cvmfs/lsst.in2p3.fr/.cvmfspublished
	
You should see a line containning `HTTP/1.0 200 OK` which indicates that your machine can talk to the relevant server.

# Frequently Asked Questions

* **How can I provide feedback?**

  Your feedback is very welcome. Please feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/airnandez/lsst-cvmfs/issues).

*  **Where can I get more detailed information on CernVM FS?**

	The [CernVM FS downloads page](http://cernvm.cern.ch/portal/filesystem/downloads) contains additional information. In addition, you may want to read the [CernVM FS Technical Information](http://cernvm.cern.ch/portal/filesystem/techinformation) for more in-depth information on how CernVM FS works.	

* **Can I use my remote LSST software distribution while disconnected from the network?**

  The CernVM FS client caches all the file metadata and the contents of the accessed remote files in the local disk of your computer. If you have previously used the stack it is likely that the relevant files are locally available in your local disk, in which case, you may work while disconnected. However, we have not tested this thoroughly, so let us know how it works for you.
  
* **Can I use this for my Docker containers?**

  Yes, you can configure your container for automatically mounting a read-only file system with LSST software stack ready to use. SÃ©bastien Binet did exactly this, so you can just use as is or as a baseline for your own containers. You will find all the details [here](https://github.com/hepsw/docks/tree/master/cvmfs-lsst).
